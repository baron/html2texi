   Welcome to my little bit of the world. The above menu will get you
to everything officially sanctioned. But if you want some more
explanatory guidance...

   In my spare time I sometimes write software
(projects/software/index.html). In other bits of my spare time, I
write (projects/writings/index.html) the occasional thought, story or
essay. For a while, I collected reviews (guitar/index.html) of
classical guitar sheet music. And then sometimes I do mildly random
things like the sara-smiles (sara-smiles.html) page. Still being a
novice at all of this, I'm keeping a record of what, how and why I do
to I have a few pictures (images/index.html). There is a big list of
other sites (linkfarm.html) I want to keep track of as well. Here is
also a list of everything (.files.html) I'm willing to admit
responsibility for. But if you want a more organized index have a
look at the site map (sitemap.html).
