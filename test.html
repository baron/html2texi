Welcome to my little bit of the world. The above menu will get you
to everything officially sanctioned. But if you want some more
explanatory guidance...
<p>
In my spare time I sometimes write <a
href="projects/software/index.html">software</a>. In other bits of my
spare time, I <a href="projects/writings/index.html">write</a> the
occasional thought, story or essay. For a while, I collected <a
href="guitar/index.html">reviews</a> of classical guitar sheet
music. And then sometimes I do mildly random things like the <a
href="sara-smiles.html">sara-smiles</a> page. Still being a novice at
all of this, I'm keeping a record of what, how and why I do to <a
href="projects/admin.html"><build/a> this site. For the graphically inclined,
I have a few <a href="images/index.html">pictures</a>. There is a big
list of <a href="linkfarm.html">other sites</a> I want to keep track
of as well. Here is also a list of <a href=".files.html">everything</a>
I'm willing to admit responsibility for. But if you want a more
organized index, have a look at the <a href="sitemap.html">site map</a>.
