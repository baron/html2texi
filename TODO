TODO list for html2texi: [JMJ]

This file is part of html2texi. See the file COPYING for copying
conditions.

* portability issues

** strdup, strndup need to be provided if not present

* Presentation issues

** have another go at the manual

** provide more test html and tell automake what to do with it

* Tasks that are required for html2texi to do a reasonably thorough job

** add entity translations

** html tables

** arrange for @alias commands and such at the top of the texinfo
  output

** make it possible to discard or @ignore or @html or warn about or somehow catch unrecognized html

* Tasks that would be nice if html2texi handled

** write <a href=...> to email and newsgroups as such

** command line options (partially irrelevant since we write to
   stdout)

*** allow user to specify input_suffix and output_suffix (e.g. .htm
    and .txi respectively)

*** allow user to specify the directory to which output is written 

*** allow user to specify output filename

*** allow user to specify whether to overwrite existing files

*** --help and --version

*** option for verbosity

** Support numbering control attributes for list elements

** support INS and DEL elements explicitly?

** take into account html version/lang info

** account for block-level versus inline elements

* Miscellaneous comments:

** we output too many newlines, but the block/inline distinction would probably help this
